1. ATTENTION: IMPORTANT INFORMATION
This chapter contains a summary of key information not provided in the manual.

Additional commands:
Press Enter or X to focus temporarily on the last of your units to come under attack.

Press the Space bar to display the nourishment level and life points of your human units on screen.

Enemy clans: 
Some mission objectives include eliminating an entire enemy clan. An enemy clan is a clan with which you have not signed an alliance.

Number of settlers per building: 
In most cases, the more settlers a building contains, the greater its productivity.

Destroying your own buildings: 
You can destroy one of your own buildings to recover part of the resources used to build them. Select the building, press Delete, and validate by clicking on the left mouse button.

Maximum number of discoveries: 
Settlers assigned to your research lab(s) can make a maximum of two discoveries per mission.

Research areas: 
From the third mission onwards, it is important to monitor the areas in which you undertake research.

Tips for beginners:
Remember to save frequently. You can save over a previous version.

Alliances: 
Alliances are vital and should not be neglected. It is very difficult to get through all of the missions (and some missions in particular) without allies. Alliances and the good will of computer-controlled players are carried over from one mission to the next.

Empty buildings (i.e. containing no settlers): 
The first player to place a settler inside gets to keep them. Do not leave certain buildings unoccupied. Remember that you must have a Sanctuary to strike alliances and a Market as well as a Hangar to trade. If you do not have these buildings, you run the risk of losing an opportunity to sign an alliance or to trade with other players. 

Special weapons: 
The Boomer and the Tower Cannon are particularly dangerous weapons that can cause damage not just on the square that is hit, but on each of the eight adjacent squares as well.

2. MANUAL SUPPLEMENT

This chapter provides detailed information not contained in the manual. Each item refers to the corresponding page of the manual. 

Page 5: Game objective

Technological discoveries and good will are carried over from one mission to the next. From the third mission onwards, it is important to monitor the areas in which you undertake research.

You may also decide to sign an early (and perhaps lasting) alliance with another player at the beginning of the game. 

The objectives of some missions include eliminating an entire enemy clan. An enemy clan is a clan with which you have not signed an alliance.

Disk Space: 50 Mb minimum, 65 Mb recommended
If you want to install Direct X, you need an extra 15 Mb

Sound control
Before launching the game, in Windows, click with the right mouse button on the loud-speaker icon at the bottom of the screen, and select Volume control.

Use the left mouse button to adjust the volume:
- The Volume control cursor adjusts the overall volume.
- The Wave cursor adjusts the volume of sound effects.
- The CD-Audio cursor adjusts the volume of the music.

Page 7: Menus
New options in the Pause menu include:
- Abort the mission and return to introduction menu.
- Return to the beginning of the mission and start over.

Page 13: The mini map
How to use the mini map:
Select a unit and use the mini map to indicate where you want the unit to go, then click on the left mouse button. 

Click on the mini map with the left mouse button to shift the screen to the designated spot.

Page 18: Selecting and controlling a building or a vehicle
In most cases, the more Settlers a building contains, the greater its productivity. For example, it will take less time to train a Swordsman if the barracks contain four Settlers instead of one. Similarly, two Settlers in the lab will discover new technologies faster than one. 

It is often more efficient to have several buildings with the same function. This applies to the Laboratory, the Garage, the Sanctuary, the Barracks, the Workshop, the Temple and the Circus. For instance, if you have several Laboratories, you will discover new technologies faster, and if each lab contains two Settlers instead of one, the process will be faster still. All told, you can accelerate the pace of research by up to 100%. 

Similarly, if you build several storehouses, you increase your overall storage capacity.

Page 28: Recycling resources
When a building or vehicle is destroyed, all or part of the materials can be reused. When one of your buildings is destroyed, half of the resources used to build it are automatically added to your stocks. If one of your vehicles is destroyed, all of the parts used to build it are scattered where the vehicle was destroyed. 

You can destroy your own buildings, but not your other assets. To destroy one of your buildings, you must have at least one settler inside. Select the building, press Delete and validate by clicking on the left mouse button. 

Page 29: Mission menus - Inventions
You keep your technological discoveries from one mission to the next. From the third mission on, it is important to monitor the areas in which you conduct research.

During the first two missions, you cannot conduct research. Moreover, research in Religion and Magic is possible only once you have discovered the Crystal Gate. When the game begins, you already have certain technologies, such as the ability to build a Sanctuary or to train a Swordsman. This is why research is already at an advanced stage when the third mission begins. 

Settlers assigned to the research lab(s) can make at most two discoveries per mission. After that, they feel so satisfied with what they have accomplished that they stop working and promptly dose off. If, by the end of the mission, they have made just one discovery or no discovery at all, the level of research achieved is carried over to the following mission. 

To keep track of how well your researchers are doing, press Esc to return to the menu and select Mission objective. A percentage appears which indicates how much of the research underway has been achieved. 

Chapter 13 contains a complete list of all the inventions in each of the four research areas.

It is nearly impossible to discover all of the major inventions of the four fields of research during a single game. Once you have accomplished all of the missions, we recommend trying a different research strategy in the following game. 

Pages 34 and 35: Trading, making an offer

Tips on how to use the Market:
When you send a messenger to a player controlled by the computer, the lower part of the box indicates which of the computer playerís goods you are interested in buying. The upper part of the box shows what you are prepared to pay in exchange. Your offer has an impact on the computer playerís good will. 

When the computer player sends you a messenger, the lower part of the box shows what the computer player wants. This cannot be modified. The upper part of the box shows what you want from the computer player. The goods displayed on top are those of the computer player. 

Page 36: Making and breaking alliances

Breaking an alliance:
If you are already allied to a player and you send a messenger to the playerís Sanctuary, this automatically breaks the alliance.

Computer-controlled players have a certain amount of good will towards you. This is what determines the success or failure of alliances with these players as well as the quality of trade offers. 

A playerís good will is negatively affected by:
Any type of aggression, for instance, attacking the playerís units or buildings or stealing their goods (major negative impact).
Any unfriendly act, for instance, turning down or breaking an alliance, or not respecting the terms of a deal (negative impact).

Factors that affect a playerís good will in a positive way include:
Trading with the player (major positive impact).
Periods with no fighting (positive impact).

Note that clans have their moods and that their good will can drop or increase suddenly for no apparent reason.

Note also that, independently of the good will factor, your chances of striking an alliance are greater if you do not already have an alliance with another player.

9. DETAILS ON UNITS AND VEHICLES
Each unit or vehicle has the following characteristics:

Damage: the average damage that it can inflict on a target. A figure is given for each type of target, by order of importance: Military/Civilian/Vehicles/Shadow Creatures/Buildings.

Vision: the troopsí ray of vision.

Range: Range of action, rated from 1 upward. E.g. a military unit rated 1 can fight only in hand-to-hand combat.

Recharge: the number of Time Units (TU) between strikes for military units and vehicles; the number of Time Units needed for harvesting, mining and scrounging for civilian units. 

Production: the number of Time Units needed to train a human unit or construct a building or vehicle.

Cost: in units of Vegetables/Stone/Spare parts.

Protection: resistance to damage, rated 1 to 3.

One time unit (TU) is between one tenth and one one-hundredth of a second, depending on the power of your computer.

Each human unit consumes one portion of food every 3,000 TU, until new inventions increase the effectiveness of food portions. 

All vehicles and human units have 100 resistance points. When 100 points of damage have been inflicted, the human unit (or vehicle) is destroyed.

The resistance of buildings is equal to the time it takes to build them (see Construction, in Details on buildings).

A damage report is provided for each hit. With Shadow Creatures, this is particularly helpful, since the damage inflicted can vary considerably.
