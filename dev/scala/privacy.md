# Privacy Policy

Last update: September 26, 2022

## What does this privacy policy cover?

This policy covers **M&N Scala**, also referred to as:
- *app*
- *application*
- *service*
- */b/scala*
- **scala**
- **GroupHub**

This app was developed by **Nelson Mimura Gonzalez**, also referred to as:
- *we*
- *us*
- *our*

We refer as "*you*", "*your*", to the individual, company, or other legal entity
using our app.

## What personal information do we collect?

**Actively collected**

We define as *actively collected* any data that you disclose to us while using
our app or when you contact us.

Specifically, our app collects, by direct input from you, user-generated content
such as profile-related information. Note however, as specified in the next
section, that none of these data is visible outside the group (also referred to
as org) you are sharing your data with. Information shared with one group is not
visible by members from other groups -- including groups you also are part of.
Also, we implement full encryption of data so that no one, including us, outside
group members you deliberately decide to share with, can read your data.

**Passively collected**

We define as *passively collected* any data that is automatically collected as
part of third-party libraries and services used by our app.

Specifically, our app collects data from your device to provide features such as
targeted advertising and improved user experience. By using our app you agree
and consent with the collection of this data.

- coarse location, such as your IP address
- device identification, such as the device advertising identifier
- usage data, such as product interaction and advertising data
- diagnostics, such as crash data and performance data

None of these data are used to identify you or for tracking purposes.

## How do we use your personal information?

**Actively collected**

The actively collected information is strictly used to create a user profile
that is unique to each group (org) you are part of. By providing your
information, whether personal or not, to each group you participate, you consent
with sharing this information with whoever the group administrators define that
should be able to see this information. Do not join and/or do not provide your
information to groups you do not know the owners and/or participants.

**Passively collected**

This informaton is used by third-party services such as Google AdMob, to deliver
targeted ads to you, and Google Analytics, to gather usage information to
improve our app. These are the relevant links to the privacy policies and other
useful information on potential third-party services being used by our app:

- [Google AdMob](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543)
- [Google Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics)

From "[behavioral
policies](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/2753860?hl=en&ref_topic=9756841)",
under "AdMob & AdSense" program policies:

> Google may use the advertising ID from the device on which the ad is serving
> to generate interests and demographics (for example, 'sports enthusiasts').
> Interests, demographics, and [other
> data](https://support.google.com/adsense/troubleshooter/1631343) may be used
> to serve better targeted ads to the user. Additionally, your app's privacy
> policy may need to be updated to reflect the use of personalized advertising
> (formerly known as interest-based advertising) served via the Google Mobile
> Ads SDK. Please take a moment to review your app's privacy policies and ensure
> that they are up-to-date. Because publisher pages and laws vary across
> countries, we're unable to suggest specific privacy policy language.
>
> To complement personalized advertising (formerly known as interest-based
> advertising), [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) lets users
> view and edit their interests and demographics. Some users may choose to opt
> out of personalized ads.

## Do we share your personal information with anyone?

**Actively collected**

The personal information you provide in the context of creating a group profile,
which is specific to each group you participate, is shared with other users from
that group, or a subset of users from that group. Information shared with one
group is not visible by other groups. Moreover, group administrators may limit
visibility even further to only specific members of a group.

We do not share your personal information beyond this context, and we cannot
decrypt and read your personal information.

**Passively collected**

Passively collected data is shared with third-party services such as Google
AdMob and Google Analytics, including whatever resources and components these
services may use to implement their features.

## Do we keep any personal information?

**Actively collected**

Personal information is stored in our database so that other group members may
see whatever information you may share with them. We implement full encryption
of personal data using three separate sets of keys -- user keys, public-private
keys, and organization (group) keys. These are used to encrypt user profiles and
user-generated content, including group-specific profiles. We do not have any
visibility to user content, except for email addresses -- which are used for
sign up and sign in.

**Passively collected**

We do not keep any passively collected data. Third-party services that make use
of this data to provide their features may keep this data stored in some form
for a specific time.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as
anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites
that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

Our app does not use cookies explicitly. However, our app may use third-party
code and libraries that use cookies to collect information and improve their
services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know
when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies,
you may not be able to use some portions of our app.

## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

### Legal bases

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain
the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information.
We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and
when we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under the
applicable law.

**Specifically**, our app collects and processes your personal data, either
actively or passively, with your consent -- i.e., only if you have given us
permission to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can
withdraw your consent at any time -- click [here](#withdraw-consent) to learn
more. For actively collected information you consent with providing your
information as part of the core functionalities offered by our app. For
passively collected information we ask for your consent before using your data.
Your consent can then be reset, reconfigured, and revoked.

We will also collect and process your personal information:

- when necessary for complying with legal obligations, such as cooperating with
  law enforcement bodies or regulatory agencies, exercising or defending our
  legal rights, or disclosing your information as evidence in litigation in
  which we are involved; and

- when we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or vital
  interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to
  the safety of any person.

### Privacy rights

In some regions, such as the European Economica Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK),
and Canada, you have rights that allow greater access and control over your
personal information.

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Canada, you have certain rights under
applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request
access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request
rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal
information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain
circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your
personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us -- please
refer to section ["Contact us"](#contact-us). We will consider and act upon any
request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing
your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local
data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here:
https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm. If
you are located in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection
authorities are available here: https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html.

### Withdraw consent

You can withdraw your consent to us collecting and processing your personal
information at any time. Actively collected data is part of the core
functionality offered by our app. If you do not consent to actively collected
data, you must not use our app anymore. If you consent with activelt collected
data but not with passively collected data, these data will only be collected
after obtaining your consent. You may deny when first questioned about it or you
may reset and revoke your consent using the appropriate options in our app.
**Specifically**, our app provides specific options to reset consent options and
to show the consent form, through which the user may accept or deny the passive
collection of data.

## California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

If you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding
access to your personal information. California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also
known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California
residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge,
information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to
third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all
third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately
preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make
such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact
information -- see section ["Contact us"](#contact-us).

If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered
account with Services, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data
that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such data, please
contact us using the contact information provided below and include the email
address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in
California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the
Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or
comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g., backups, etc.).

### CCPA Privacy Notice

The California Code of Regulations defines a "resident" as:

- (1) every individual who is in the State of California for other than a
  temporary or transitory purpose and

- (2) every individual who is domiciled in the State of California who is
  outside the State of California for a temporary or transitory purpose

All other individuals are defined as "non-residents". If this definition of
"resident" applies to you, we must adhere to certain rights and obligations
regarding your personal information.

### What categories of personal information do we collect?

We have collected the following categories of personal information in the past
twelve (12) months:

- (F) Internet or other similar network activity (e.g., browsing history, search
  history, online behavior, interest data, and interactions with our and other
  websites, applications, systems, and advertisements);

- (G) Geolocation data (e.g., device location); and

- (K) Inferences drawn from other personal information (e.g., inferences drawn
  from any of the collected personal information listed above to create a
  profile or summary about, for example, an individual’s preferences and
  characteristics).

We may also collect other personal information outside of these categories
instances where you interact with us in person, online, or by phone or mail in
the context of:

- Receiving help through our customer support channels;
- Participation in customer surveys or contests; and
- Facilitation in the delivery of our Services and to respond to your inquiries.

### How do we use and share your personal information?

We collect and share your personal information through:

-	Targeting cookies/Marketing cookies

More information about our data collection and sharing practices can be found in
this privacy notice. If you are using an authorized agent to exercise your right
to opt out we may deny a request if the authorized agent does not submit proof
that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf.

### Will your information be shared with anyone else?

We may disclose your personal information with our service providers pursuant to
a written contract between us and each service provider. Each service provider
is a for-profit entity that processes the information on our behalf.

We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for
undertaking internal research for technological development and demonstration.
This is not considered to be "selling" of your personal information.

We have not sold any personal information to third parties for a business or
commercial purpose in the preceding twelve (12) months. In the preceding twelve
(12) months we have disclosed data in the categories described in the prior
section on ["What categories of personal information do we
collect?"](#what-categories-of-personal-information-do-we-collect).

### Your rights with respect to your personal data

- *Right to request deletion of the data — Request to delete*. You can ask for
  the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your
  personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal
  information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not
  limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free
  speech, our compliance requirements resulting from a legal obligation, or any
  processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.

- *Right to be informed — Request to know*. Depending on the circumstances, you
  have a right to know: whether we collect and use your personal information;
  the categories of personal information that we collect; the purposes for which
  the collected personal information is used; whether we sell your personal
  information to third parties; the categories of personal information that we
  sold or disclosed for a business purpose; the categories of third parties to
  whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose;
  and the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal
  information.

  In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete
  consumer information that is de-identified in response to a consumer request
  or to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request.

- *Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights*.
  We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.

- *Verification process*. Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify
  your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the
  information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to
  provide information so that we can match it with information you have
  previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you
  submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
  information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we
  may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you
  have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as
  the circumstances dictate. We will only use personal information provided in
  your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the
  extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for
  the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from
  the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
  additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for
  security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally
  provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

- *Other privacy rights*. You may object to the processing of your personal
  information. You may request correction of your personal data if it is
  incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the
  information. You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the
  CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does
  not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf
  in accordance with the CCPA. You may request to opt out from future selling of
  your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request,
  we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than
  fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.

Please contact us to exercise these rights -- see section ["Contact
us"](#contact-us).

privacy policy. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security
practices and policies of any third parties, including ones that may be linked
