## What does this privacy policy cover?

This policy covers the **M&N Unit Converter**, also referred to as:

This app was developed by **Nelson Mimura Gonzalez**, also referred to as:
- *we*
- *us*
- *our*

We refer as "*you*", "*your*", to the individual, company, or other legal entity
using our app.

## What personal information do we collect?

**Actively collected**

Our app collects, by direct input from you, values in a specific unit of
measurement to be converted to another unit of measurement.

**Passively collected**

Our app may collect data from your device via third-party libraries used in our
app to provide features such as targeted advertising and improved user
experience. By using our app you agree and consent with the collection of this
data.

- coarse location, such as your IP address
- device identification, such as the device advertising identifier
- usage data, such as product interaction and advertising data
- diagnostics, such as crash data and performance data

## How do we use your personal information?

**Actively collected**

The actively collected information is strictly used to convert values from one
unit of measurement to another. We do not store nor keep private data in your
device, nor in any systems we may own.

**Passively collected**

This informaton is used by third-party services such as Google AdMob, to deliver
targeted ads to you, and Google Analytics, to gather usage information to
improve our app. These are the relevant links to the privacy policies and other
useful information on potential third-party services being used by our app:

- [Google AdMob](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543)
- [Google Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics)

From "[behavioral
policies](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/2753860?hl=en&ref_topic=9756841)",
under "AdMob & AdSense" program policies:

> Google may use the advertising ID from the device on which the ad is serving
> to generate interests and demographics (for example, 'sports enthusiasts').
> Interests, demographics, and [other
> data](https://support.google.com/adsense/troubleshooter/1631343) may be used
> to serve better targeted ads to the user. Additionally, your app's privacy
> policy may need to be updated to reflect the use of personalized advertising
> (formerly known as interest-based advertising) served via the Google Mobile
> Ads SDK. Please take a moment to review your app's privacy policies and ensure
> that they are up-to-date. Because publisher pages and laws vary across
> countries, we're unable to suggest specific privacy policy language.
>
> To complement personalized advertising (formerly known as interest-based
> advertising), [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) lets users
> view and edit their interests and demographics. Some users may choose to opt
> out of personalized ads.
